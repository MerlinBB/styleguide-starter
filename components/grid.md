The xs grid always retains it's columns.

But the grid can also stack at threee different breakpoints.

- Small (sm)
- Medium (md)
- Large (lg)


Similar to Bootstrap grids it can also uses offset. eg:


```
.col-sm-offset-4
```

You can also use the container class to contain the fluid grid...

```
.container
```
